## Vandebron Frontend Developer Take-home Assessment
Thanks for applying to Vandebron!! If you've made it this far we already think you're pretty great. Your assignment is below.

- [ ] Fork the repo and decide on a framework you'd like to complete the project in (currently only React)
- [ ] Start the project by following the "Getting Started" instructions in the example project. Notice compare what your app looks like now with the desired app shown below.

![Goal app](web/goal-app.png)

- [ ] There are several areas you can focus on. Pick what you'd like to focus on and implement those. Please don't take more than 4 hours on this.
  - [ ] Update styling of the app to make it look like the goal app above. Note that you do not need to spend any time on the following
      - Implement components other than what is visible in the goal app
      - Using the correct icons
  - [ ] There are a few bugs in the app - feel free to fix any that you find
  - [ ] Calculate the estimated usage based on the inputs provided - there are no strict rules here but generally the "bigger" the house, the higher your consumption, same for amount of people, etc. Should return a type of `{ electricity: number, gas?: number }`
  - [ ] For several reasons, the app isn't production-ready. Make changes so that we can be confident the app will run without issue once we're ready to release.
  - List some suggestions for future improvements you would make if you were given more time.

  - [ ] Wouldn't it be great if this app were dockerized?
  - [ ] Anything else you think would be good
- [ ] Send the forked repo as a PR


During your in-person interview, we'll review your PR so be ready to discuss the changes you've made. Happy coding ðŸ˜ƒ!!
